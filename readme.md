# Dev Challenge (Frontend Mobile) - Graph

## Task Description:

Develop a frontend mobile app that fetches temperature data for Helsinki from the Open Meteo API, visualizes the data into a graph and allows the user to change which dates temperature the graph shows. The app should be built using React Native.

Recommended amount of time to spend is around 4 hours. If everything cannot be done in time prioritize instead what showcases your skills. Tracking what you spent the time on is not necessary.

Remember you can always reach out if you have any questions!

## Some recommended features for the app

- Fetching weather data of Helsinki from the free Open Meteo API [https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api)
- Visualizing the temperature as a chart one day at a time
- Possibility to swipe or scroll the chart to change which days is displayed
- Offline support. E.q. it should display cached values even if device is offline

## Tips and hints

- **You can ONLY get weather data from open-meteo API with a delay of 5-8 days. E.q. on 25th you might only have weather data until 18th day or so!!**
- Feel free to use any 3rd party libraries. For example, we have left the possible chart library choice open on purpose.

## What we'll be looking for

- Clean and reasonable technical and UX decisions and the ability to argument about them.
- Ability to prioritize and recognize what is valuable - focus on those aspects of this task where you can showcase your skills.
