# Dev Challenge (Frontend Mobile) - Graph

## Task Description:

Develop a frontend mobile app that fetches temperature data for Helsinki from the OpenWeatherMap API, visualizes the data into a graph, and allows users to change the timespan of the graphs displayed data in one day increments. The app should be built using React Native.

Donâ€™t spend more than 4 hours on the task. If everything cannot be done in time prioritise instead what feels most important to you. Tracking what you spent the time on is not necessary and you don't need to complete the task in one go.

Remember you can always reach out if you have any questions!

## Recommended features of the app

- Fetching weather data of Helsinki from the free OpenWeatherMap API [https://openweathermap.org/forecast5](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)
- Visualizing the temperature as a chart one day at a time
- Changing which days data is displayed

## Tips and hints

- You need to register to openweathermap.org to get a free API key. Their API key may take a few hours to become active.
- You can only go 5 days backwards with the OpenWeatherMap forecast5 endpoint.
- Feel free to use any libraries that make most sense to you or nothing at all. For example, we have left the possible chart library choice open on purpose.
- Make sure to showcase your strengths

## What we'll be looking for

- Clean and reasonable choices/decisions and the ability to argument about them.
- Ability to prioritize and recognize what is valuable - focus on those aspects of this task where you can showcase your skills.

The email should contain:
- A brief demo video or a set of screenshots showcasing the app's functionality.
